            >Cybunnies are one of many different species that exist in Neopia.
            As a general rule Cybunnies love the colder regions of Neopia, their
            thick white fur not only keeps them warm, but also helps them blend
            in with the snowy mountainside.</cite

        <p>
          Going along with what should now be an obvious theme, I just thought
          bunnies were very cute, and got myself a bunny-like pet. Technically,
          I was trying to obtain a different baby pet through less than legal
          means (the old "send me 100,000 Neopoints and I'll send you my rare
          pet" scam), but the scammer realized she had little time left with her
          account, and just said "here, take this one, I don't care anymore."
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheading__section">Color Choice</h3>
        <p>
          Trippinhun came pre-painted, which is great because in those days, a
          Baby Paint Brush was very expensive. The design wasn't the greatest,
          but the <em>idea</em> was there, so I used the excuse of her color to
          draw a baby bunny and enter it in the drawing competition.

              When Neopets redid all the artwork of the pets, Cybunnies got a
              makeover so that they could better face the camera, wear various
              articles of clothing, and hold items in their front paws. Baby
              pets remain difficult to customize, as they're still just a little
              too custom to really do anything with. My favorite part of this
              change is that they now look less cross-eyed.
