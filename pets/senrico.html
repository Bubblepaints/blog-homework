            Shoyrus are fantastic flyers who love to soar through the skies.

        <h2 class="subheading">History</h2>
        <h3 class="subheading__section">Origins</h3>
        <p>
          Shoyrus are the number one most popular Neopet, by the website's own
          statistics, meaning that more people have created a Shoyru than any
          other species. Statistics aside, I've always liked dragons as well,
          and so I thought a cool-looking pirate dragon would be a fun pet to
          have.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheading__section">Color Choice</h3>
        <p>
          There are many good color options for Shoyrus, and Senrico has gone
          through several in his lifetime. Originally, I created him with the
          color Blue. I then painted him rainbow, which he stayed as for several
          years, before finally deciding on Pirate. In the old days, before
          Neopets could wear clothing, the colors that added clothing were
          highly coveted.

            <div class="new-art__image-container">
              <img
                src="../images/shoyru2.png"
                alt="A Western dragon in a pirate outfit"
                class="new-art__image"

          <div>
            <p>
              When Neopets redid all the artwork of the pets, Shoyrus got a
              makeover so that they could better face the camera, wear various
              articles of clothing, and hold items in their front paws.
              Regrettably, this meant that a lot of the Neopets that had fun and
              unique poses lost those poses, including the Pirate Shoyru. I
              think the new design is <em>fine</em>, but I do still like the
              look of the old one better. My favorite addition is the piercing
              on the tail fin.
