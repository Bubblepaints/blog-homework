              Once upon a time, I moved, and had to go to a new school where I
              didn't know anyone. This was middle school, arguably the
              <i>worst</i> of the kinds of schools, so I had no friends for a
              while. What's a girl to do? Seek friendship elsewhere.

              Neopets.com is a website where you can create an account, have
              virtual pets called "neopets," play games, dress up your neopet,
              and talk to others on the site.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 2000's, it's where a lot of creative kids ended up.
              It provided a platform for sharing what you can do, like drawing
              your neopet or making them a webpage (called a "petpage").
            </p>
            <p>
              At school, nobody cared that I existed. On Neopets.com, I was
              <b>popular</b>, because I was halfway decent at drawing my pets
              and entering the art contest.

              In addition to drawing contests, there was a "site spotlight"
              contest for making an entire webpage dedicated to your pet. It
              sounded cool, and my older brother was in college studying
              computer science at the time, so I decided to give it a shot.
            </p>
            <p>
              Figuring out where to learn HTML at that time was difficult. A
              site that many users pointed to as a helpful reference was
              <u>funkychickens.com</u>, which according to the "about" section,
              was made by a <i>14-year-old</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It had everything! How to make your colors obnoxious, how to add
              autoplaying background music that can't be paused, how to make the
              text blink in and out, and of course, how to make a marquee. It
              was
              <b>perfect</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
              So most of my HTML knowledge became making and styling HTML
              tables.

              I decided I would create an <i>amazing</i>, award-winning petpage
              for my Cybunny named trippinhun. I was 13 at the time, had tried
              coffee once, and had decided that it was disgusting and that tea
              was superior in every way, so I would make a petpage all about tea
              and how awesome it is.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made some kind of <i>obnoxious</i>,
              <em class="highlight">brightly-colored</em> <b>abomination</b>,
              complete with a bunch of painstakingly illustrated elements, and
              the four horsemen of the webpage apocalypse: Comic Sans font,
              everything centered, hidden and unpausable background music, and
              HTML that nearly made me cry (in the bad way) when I looked back
              on it 20 years later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Highlights (or lowlights, really) include HTML comprised of a
              dozen or so nested "center" tags, and one place where for some
              reason I wrote "float: center" in the CSS.

              My reward for winning, along with the png of a trophy added to my
              account profile, was the thought that I could be a great
              programmer one day.

              Really, though, it was pretty impressive for the time! I submitted
              my beautiful abomination for the site spotlight, and actually won!
            </p>
            <p>
              While I'm sure an 8-year-old today can easily make something way
              better, I'm proud of what I managed to accomplish all those years
              ago. This page won the Neopets site spotlight on 08/15/2005, and
              can still be viewed today.
            </p>
            <p>
              While I ended up pursuing other interests in college, and after
              college, eventually it all came back to Neopets somehow. My best
              friend, who I met through Neopets, recommended me to her boss for
              an open front end web developer position. And that's what I do for
              a living now.
            </p>
            <p>
              If it wasn't for this ridiculous website, and the equally
              ridiculous petpage I made that won me the site spotlight, I
              probably wouldn't be a web developer today.
