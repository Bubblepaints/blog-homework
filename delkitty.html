            >Acaras are one of many different species that exist in Neopia. As a
            general rule Acaras are fantastic swimmers that are just as happy on
            land as they are underwater. Their thick fur keeps them warm when
            diving to the depths of the ocean.</cite

        <p>
          When I was a kid, Acaras were my favorite species. I just thought they
          looked neat, with their vaguely catlike appearance, weird ears, and
          horns for some reason. Delkitty got her name from the fact that
          Delcatty (the name of a Pok√©mon) was already taken, and Delkitty
          sounded close enough.
        </p>
        <h3 class="subheading__section">Color Choice</h3>
        <p>
          Yellow and pink have always been two of my favorite colors, and I felt
          this particular option had the best of both worlds for those color
          preferences.

              When Neopets redid all the artwork of the pets, Acaras got a
              makeover so that they could better face the camera, wear various
              articles of clothing, and hold items in their front paws. The
              faerie design became less unique in that it no longer had a
              different pose from other colors, but kept the faerie wings.
